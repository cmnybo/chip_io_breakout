## The Example Program
The program will read the ADC and display the voltage of all channels 10 times per second when in run mode.<br/>
Clicking the single button will read all channels once.<br/>
The DAC outputs will update immediatly when the values are changed. Enter a value between 0 and 4095 in the input and press enter to apply. Using the up/down arrows will apply it immediatly.<br/>
The voltage reference can be set to 2.048V or 2.5V. This sets the maximum input voltage of the ADC and the maximum output voltage of the DAC.<br/>
If the external reference is selected, you can apply between 1.24V and 3.3V to the Ref In pin. Enter the voltage of the external reference in the numeric input so the ADC and DAC voltages are displayed correctly.
To run this program, you need to install [spidev](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spidev) and [CHIP_IO](https://github.com/xtacocorex/CHIP_IO).<br/>
The spi2 device tree overlay must be loaded as well as the spidev kernel module. The program must be run as root in order to control the SPI and GPIO.

## Library Usage
The spidev and CHIP_IO python libraries must be installed, the spi device tree overlay and spidev module must be loaded, and python must be run as root for this to work.

Import libraries</br>
`import spiLib, max5702, max11629, time`

Open SPI device</br>
`spi = spiLib.SPI(32766, 0)`</br>
`spi.open()`

Create instance of ADC and DAC</br>
`adc = max11629.MAX11629(spi, 0)`</br>
`dac = max5702.MAX5702(spi, 1)`

Configure voltage references</br>
`adc.vRef(False) # disable internal ADC reference`</br>
`dac.vRef(True, dac.REF_20) # enable internal DAC 2.048V reference`

Write to the DAC. Maximum value is 4095.</br>
`dac.write(dac.DAC_0, 1024) # set channel 0 to 0.512V`</br>
`dac.write(dac.DAC_1, 2048) # set channel 1 to 1.024V`

Perform an ADC conversion</br>
`adc.convert(0) # start conversion on channel 0`</br>
`data = adc.read(1,False) # read one entry from ADC FIFO`</br>
`print (((data[0] << 8) | data[1]) & 0x0FFF) # print the ADC reading`

Perform an ADC scan</br>
`adc.scan() # starts a conversion on channels 0-7. takes about 30Âµs`</br>
`data = adc.read(8,False) # read 8 entries from ADC FIFO`</br>
`time.sleep(0.0001) # give it some time to finish the conversions`</br>
`# print all 8 channels`</br>
`for i in range(0, 16, 2): print (((data[i] << 8) | data[i+1]) & 0x0FFF)`

Clean up. You must run these before exiting your program to free up the SPI and GPIO pins.</br>
`spi.close()`</br>
`spi.cleanup()`</br>
